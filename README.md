Multi-mode transportation will be preferred to reach from point A to point D using different transport modes and with stops in between.

# Considerations: 

To make the trip cost-effective and less hectic by having minimal transport switches

# Assumptions:
* Careem Bus will have restricted timetables and routes. All vehicles will be available in unlimited amount.
* There will be enough captain-supply availability and constant fares estimation. Hence, project demo will be user-centric.
* Data is designed and generated by us for User, Driver, Vehicle, Location.
* Latitude and longitude obtained from user for pickup and destination are being hardcoded to a location based grid.
* In any grid field,
	* All vehicles (Bike, Rickshaw, Go, Go Mini, Bus)
	* All vehicles except bus
	* Bike and rickshaw
	* Only bike
	* NULL = Vehicle is not allowed to travel on this route
